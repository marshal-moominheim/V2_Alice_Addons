This repository holds some projects which use Project Alice's modding extensions to add neat new features to Victoria 2. At the moment, there are 2 projects available for download:

**Dynamic Civil Wars (for HPM or AHMP)**

This mod uses dynamic tags to have full civil wars which offer a more interesting experience than the clssic rebel whack-a-mole.

**Alice Buttons (for GFM)**

This mod is a bundle of three components using Alice's scriptable buttons. These are great for QOL or multiplayer.

_State Transfer Tool:_

Select or deselect provinces and states owned by you and your vassals, and transfer them to another country

_Direct Immigration:_

More direct implementation of TGC's Direct Migration mod, without the hacky buildings. Choose states to relocate from and to, whether you want to move primary, accepted, or non-accepted cultures, then hit 'begin relocation' and watch those ethnic maps change.

_Give Money:_

Direct implementation of the grant feature used in a lot of MP mods. Now you can give your friends and enemies of your enemies one of five amounts of cash directly in the diplomacy screen.
