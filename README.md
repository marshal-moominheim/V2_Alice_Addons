This repository holds some projects which use Project Alice's modding extensions to add neat new features to Victoria 2. At the moment, there are 2 projects available for download:

**CORGI-PUIR for Alice, with personal additions (CPA-Moom) - WIP**

You know you can't make a V2 mod which doesn't have a 3-letter acronym :). This started as my attempt to make CORGI work for Alice, merge in a bunch of (now-depricated) AHMP, and shovel in a lot of neat map and flag changes for LARP purposes, and then use Alice extensions to make certain MP actions easier. Notably, to the money grant feature added before, there are now also grants for key industrial and military goods.

Compared to AHMP, this mod has two notable design differences. First, instead of the AI actually being able to do anything the player can, it should only appear to be able to. The game is for the player, after all. This means I've added a couple of AI 'shackles,' especially to wargoal generation, to avoid silly or unfun outcomes. Second, I like clarity and use of base game mechanics to drive gameplay instead of event chains which may be unclear - especially to new players. This manifests in a couple of ways that I've tried to cut down on event spam, but most notably in that I've turned a couple of formables into 'unions' so they are clearer on the map. 

Open to feedback and suggestions - this is still very WIP! It runs as an addition to base CORGI, which you can find here: https://github.com/CE277/CoRGI_puir/releases. It is not meant to run on its own!

**Dynamic Civil Wars (for HPM or AHMP)**

This mod uses dynamic tags to have full civil wars which offer a more interesting experience than the clssic rebel whack-a-mole.

**Alice Buttons (for GFM)**

This mod is a bundle of three components using Alice's scriptable buttons. These are great for QOL or multiplayer.

_State Transfer Tool:_

Select or deselect provinces and states owned by you and your vassals, and transfer them to another country

_Direct Immigration:_

More direct implementation of TGC's Direct Migration mod, without the hacky buildings. Choose states to relocate from and to, whether you want to move primary, accepted, or non-accepted cultures, then hit 'begin relocation' and watch those ethnic maps change.

_Give Money:_

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/876127af-9b10-4ae3-a048-15208d573971)

Direct implementation of the grant feature used in a lot of MP mods. Now you can give your friends and enemies of your enemies one of five amounts of cash directly in the diplomacy screen.
